> Survival Analysis (XgBoost, Cox Regression, Random Forest)

To estimate a  Survival Analysis model, select the time-to-event variable, the event occurrence variable, and one or more explanatory variables. Press the `Estimate` button or `CTRL-enter` (`CMD-enter` on Mac) to generate results.

The model can be "tuned" by adjusting the parameter inputs available in ProjectFusionAI. In addition to these parameters, any others can be adjusted in _Report > Rmd_. The best way to determine the optimal values for all these hyper-tuning parameters is to use Cross-Validation, which is already done for you when you input multiple values for the hyper tuning parameters.

Here is some brief information on the tuning parameters that can be set for the Survival Analysis Model:

* Prior: Probability aassigned to the event of interest before considering the evidence.
* Max Nodes: The max number of terminal nodes (leaves) in the tree.
* Complexity: The complexity parameter used to control the size of the decision tree, to prevent overfitting.
* Prune Complexity: The complexity parameter used during pruning to control the size of the pruned tree.
* Seed: The seed value used for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of results.
* Cost: The penalty associated with misclassifying a non-event as an event.
* Margin: The margin parameter used to adjust the loss function for classification tasks.**

### Cox Regression
Cox regression, also known as the proportional hazards model, is a widely used method in survival analysis. It models the time to an event, such as failure or death, considering the effect of one or more covariates. This model assumes that the hazard ratios are constant over time, allowing for the estimation of the hazard function for individuals based on their covariate values.

### Random Forest Survival Model
The Random Forest Survival Model is an extension of the random forest algorithm tailored for survival analysis. It builds an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a bootstrapped sample of the data, and the outcome is the time to the event of interest. The Random Forest Survival Model does not assume proportional hazards and is particularly useful for capturing complex interactions between covariates without the risk of overfitting.
