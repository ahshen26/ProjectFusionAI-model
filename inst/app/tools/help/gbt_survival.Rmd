> Estimate Gradient Boosted Survival Analysis

To estimate a Gradient Boosted Survival Analysis model, select the time-to-event variable, the event occurrence variable, and one or more explanatory variables. Press the `Estimate` button or `CTRL-enter` (`CMD-enter` on Mac) to generate results.

The model can be "tuned" by adjusting the parameter inputs available in Radiant. In addition to these parameters, any others can be adjusted in _Report > Rmd_. The best way to determine the optimal values for all these hyper-parameters is to use Cross-Validation. In Radiant, you can use the `cv.gbt` function for this purpose. See the <a href="https://radiant-rstats.github.io/radiant.model/reference/cv.gbt.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> for more information.

Here is some brief information on the tuning parameters that can be set for the Survival Analysis Model:

Prior: Probability aassigned to the event of interest before considering the evidence.
Max Nodes: The max number of terminal nodes (leaves) in the tree.
Complexity: The complexity parameter used to control the size of the decision tree, to prevent overfitting.
Prune Complexity: The complexity parameter used during pruning to control the size of the pruned tree.
Seed: The seed value used for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of results.
Cost: The penalty associated with misclassifying a non-event as an event.
Margin: The margin parameter used to adjust the loss function for classification tasks.**

### R-functions
For an overview of related R-functions used by Radiant to estimate a Gradient Boosted Survival Analysis model, see <a href = "https://radiant-rstats.github.io/radiant.model/reference/index.html#section-model-gradient-boosted-trees" target="_blank">_Model > Gradient Boosted Survival Analysis_</a>.

The key function from the `xgboost` package used in the `gbt_survival` tool is `xgboost`.
